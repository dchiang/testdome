# About this project

This project is meant to share solutions to the public tests that [TestDome](https://www.testdome.com/tests "TestDome Test Page") has in its library by subject, as a way for me to improve my skills and to help other developers.

I'm starting this repository with solutions mostly made by me. If I was not able to solve an excercise but found the answer online, I'm also mentioning this in the README file of the excersise, where I also mention the author and where was the answer posted. If my solution don't pass all the test cases and I couldn't find an appropiate answer online, I'm posting my solution specifying which test cases didn't pass.

Please feel free to report any broken solution or to contribute with yours by creating a PR following the same structure I have used for the java test solution.
